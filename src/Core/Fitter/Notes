Ship Fitting notes.

Data Types

All calculations should be done using the CGFloat type.
Some attributes are stored as ints, others as flaots.  
CCP seem to store whole numbers as floats for some reason??.


Design

Each module should be able to report its skill prerequisites and what skils
affect it (for bonuses etc) in the form of an array of skillpairs.


ShipFitter class design.

The ShipFitter class represents a ship and what is fitted to it.

It needs to be able to store and orgainze the mods that have been fitted.

Calculate the CPU and Powergrid usage and bonuses of the mods that are fitted.
The highest value bonus is calculated first when it comes to calculating a bonus or stacking penalty.
	Therfore the items must be sorted by bonus amount when calculating that bonus.

Meta Level

Active / Passive modules

No easy way to determine if a module is active or passive.
Ways to check:
	It has an ammo type (chargeGroup)
	It has a duration (duration)
	It can be overheated (heatDamage)
	
Module Types
	High,
	Medium,
	Low,
	Rig Large,
	Rig Medium,
	Rig Small


Tech 3 Ships

Have no subsystem slots.
Subsystems have attributes such as hiSlotModifier, medSlotModifier, lowSlotModifier
which will add subsystems to the ship. subsystems have a fitsToShipType attribute
which restricts the ship types it can fit to.

Modules:

Have bonuses they apply to the ship (Heat Sinks increase DPS output etc) or a bonus
applied to other ships (Remote rep, EWAR, etc).

Can be active or passive.
Can have ammo. (chargeGroup)
	the chargeGroup attribute links to the invGroup groupID
Can be overheated.

Table dgmAttributeCategories lists the categories that a module effect belongs to

Module slot types comes from the dgmTypeEffect table
